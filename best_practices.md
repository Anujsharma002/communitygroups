# Best Practices

This page guides running a new Cloud Native Community Group based on the experience of existing ones.

Here is a list of suggestions and tips to get you started:

## **Create the Cloud Native Community Group**

CNCF staff is responsible for creating the Cloud Native Community Groups (see the instructions in the [README.md](../README.md) file, but please see the official [Bevy documentation on how to create a chapter](https://help.bevylabs.com/article/454-create-a-chapter).

The **description** of the group is left to the discretion of the organizers.

A brief description of the role of the CNCF and the Cloud Native approach could be added.

You can use text from the [Cloud Native Definition](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md).

The most important thing is to keep an **active group**, with frequent events (ideally once a month). We encourage folks to run either online events or regular meetup events.

Sustaining a group yourself can be challenging to manage. Ideally, it would be best if you had a team of passionate and committed co-organizers.

Joining forces helps spread the load and expands the network.

### **Find Speakers**

You should provide some **form** to allow people to submit their talk proposal similar to this:

> **_Note_**: Make a copy! Please do not edit that form.

When possible, take care to review their presentations.

Attend **conferences** (e.g, DockerCon, CloudNativeCon, etc.) where you can find speakers and meet many people who use or are involved in the CNCF projects that may be interested in joining your group.

### **Find sponsors/place**

You should contact local technology companies. Many of them are interested in hosting such kind of events.

It is better to find a place in a central location. Downtown would be ideal because it's easier to access for most of the attendees.

### **Schedule a new event**

First of all, don't forget to thank your sponsors.

Then the essential information is about the agenda. Each talk description should contain:

```
- A short bio of the speaker
- An attractive title
- A paragraph describing the content of the presentation/demo
```

If you're planning a hands-on demo, you should ensure that the WiFi can handle the number of attendees.

Furthermore, you should check you're not limited by some quotas (Cloud provider).

The choice of date and time matters. Most meetups choose Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after work.

### **Booking**

If the room capacity limits you, you should do an **overbooking**.

Most of the time, there are 30% of people who RSVP, but they never come.

You should think about sending a **reminder** message to the meetup group to ask the people to free their place if they can't come.

### **Post event**

If possible, you should record videos of the presentations and take pictures for social media and the event page to share afterward.

You should also **share** the slides with all members after the event. Optionally, please submit them to the [CNCF Presentations repo](https://github.com/cncf/presentations) on GitHub.

### **CNCF swag**

If you're a newly created meetup and added to meetups.cncf.io, please reach out to meetups@cncf.io for a complimentary $50 swag certificate to the [CNCF Store](https://store.cncf.io).

### **Ask for help**

If you have any other questions, you can ask them in the [CNCF Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T08PSQ7BQ/C015WPLD3F1).
