## Program description

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation supports the worldwide community of the Cloud Native Community Groups (CNCG) - <https://community.cncf.io/>.

CNCF is currently working on expanding the Cloud Native community worldwide, and we are happy to accept the new local communities to join our network.

If you are interested in joining the list of official CNCF Community Groups, please review the information below.

Cloud Native Community Groups program is powered by the [Bevy platform](https://www.bevy.com/), and managed by the CNCF staff.

## Benefits of joining the CNCF Community Groups Program

For all Cloud Native Community Groups, CNCF offers the following benefits:

- One-time complimentary swag certificate ($50 USD) to the [CNCF Store](https://store.cncf.io/) (available after at hosting at least two successful events per chapter).
- Boosting the visibility of your community group and events
- Cost coverage for the hosted community platform

## Best Practices

Please check out our [best_practices](./best_practices.md).

## How to apply?

- The Cloud Native Community Group has to be created following the best practices described above.
- Visit <https://community.cncf.io/>, and click "Log In" in the top right; you will be redirected to the Linux Foundation sign-in. Use your credentials or create a new account.
- Please provide additional information via filling the [form](https://forms.gle/HaTM3d5vbHWop8qQ6).
  - _Please note that this form is used for inviting the new Community Groups organizers only. If an active Community Group already exists in your region, please reach out to the organizers directly (do not use the form above - the submitted application will be declined)._

Once completed, CNCF staff will provide you with access to your group.

### CNCF Projects

CNCF is also happy to provide the space for projects communities at <https://community.cncf.io> (eg. to host the regular community meetings).

To request a community chapter for the CNCF project, please file a ticket to the CNCF ServiceDesk - <https://servicedesk.cncf.io> (available for the project maintainers listed here - <https://maintainers.cncf.io/>).

### How to enable the sync with Meetup.com?

- The integration syncs events from Bevy to Meetup. It connects your Bevy group with your existing Meetup group and helps track member attendance and analytics. This integration requires adding the CNCF Meetup Pro account as a co-organizer on your Meetup group.

- The "CNCF Meetup Account" has to be added to your Meetup Group (CNCF staff is managing this account), so please apply via the form above mentioning the Meetup Group URL. If you run multiple groups, please apply every time with the new group URL.

- Once the CNCF account joins your group, you'll need to follow the "Appoint New Leadership Member" steps here: <https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002879411-Managing-a-leadership-team> to add cncf-meetup-admin@cncf.io as a co-organizer. Please see the sample video on how to do this - <https://share.getcloudapp.com/8LujxJ85>.

**Please note:**

- the events sync between Bevy and Meetup is only available to the groups that have already joined the [CNCF Meetup Pro network](https://www.meetup.com/pro/cncf) before July 1st, 2020!
- To have the events sync with Meetup.com working correctly, please make sure that the "CNCF Meetup Account" is added to your group as a co-organizer! If this is not done, Bevy won't be able to create events on Meetup!
- The steps described above do not migrate the existing users from a Meetup group to the new Community Group. More details about this could be found at the FAQ - <https://github.com/cncf/communitygroups/blob/main/FAQ.md#why-cant-you-simply-create-an-account-for-everyone-from-meetup-to-bevy>.

## Bevy Training

CNCF and Bevy have organized the training session for the Community Groups organizers. It has been recorded and now available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rBdomoYlmc).

### Bevy Help Portal

Bevy Help Portal is available at <https://help.bevylabs.com/>.

## Communication

Please reach out to us on the #communitygroups channel on the [CNCF slack](https://slack.cncf.io/). Please don't use DMs unless strictly necessary as doing so both has the potential of overwhelming project maintainers and others with similar questions lose the benefit of public discussion.

It's best if you use a public communication channel whenever possible; however, if you need to communicate in private, please feel free to send the program admins a note via meetups@cncf.io (please use the public channels for any program-related discussion).

### Support

- If you have any technical difficulties with the platform itself, please reach out to the [Bevy platform support](https://help.bevylabs.com/) directly.

#### Troubleshooting

The troubleshooting guide by Bevy is available [here](https://help.bevylabs.com/article/499-troubleshooting).

#### FAQ

## Code of Conduct

Cloud Native Community Groups follow the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
